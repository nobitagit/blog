title: Lunch break talks 2 - Things I wish I knew when I was younger
---

> I like to watch talks during my lunch breaks, so I share some of the best ones I bump into, along with my notes.

There are at least 3 reasons why a talk from [Simon Sinek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sinek) is pretty much always worth your time:

1. He picks simple yet clever and entertaining topics
2. He is a great motivator
3. He's one of the best public speakers around.

See for yourself.

## "See the bagel"

> Cafeteria tables, aligned next to each other and a long line of runners hoping to get a free bagel. So I said to my friend "Let's get a bagel".
> He looked at me and said "No man, the line is too long".
> And I looked at him and said: "It's a free bagel!"

- 2 ways you can see the world. You can see the thing you want, or you can see the thing standing in the way
- Focus on your goals, not on what's standing in the way
- If you focus on the end result, the obstacle is an opportunity for innovation

## Perspective matters

- Interpret nerves as excitement. Same symptoms (heart beat, sweat etc), totally different mindset
- Being nervous (negative) vs being excited (positive)

## Give yourself to your team members selflessly

- The highest performing teams on the planet are not the strongest, not the strongest, not the fastest. They are the ones that **give to each other selflessly**
- "You are here because someone took care of you and you have the responsibility to take care of others. This is the **core of leadership**.

## Listen first, speak last

- Be a great listener by allowing others to talk first
- Ensure they **feel listened**
- Great leaders don't start the conversation, they **end it**
- Practice to be the last to speak when you're part of a team

## Don't panic

- Don't panic, so people around you stay calm
- We confuse moments of happiness with fulfilment
- Fulfilment is entirely different

## "We all deserve a styrofoam cup"

- [Hear the story](https://youtu.be/p9gzGmyDJvc?t=1258)
- Rewards and accolades are given not to you, but to the position you hold

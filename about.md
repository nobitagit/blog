Hello, my name is Aurelio and I am a software engineer based in Berlin.
I love my job and I have a burning desire to learn and improve.  
I mostly write for myself but I am always happy to hear feedback about my posts and, in general, to connect with anyone that wants to share ideas.

If you want to know more about me you check my [homepage](https://aurelio.me/).
